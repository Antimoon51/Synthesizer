# Synthesizer

A projekt for University

Goal is to develop a working digital synthesizer on the Cypress FM4 Controllerboard ([this one](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/sk-fm4-176l-s6e2cc-fm4-family-quick-start-guide)).


Download the branch software synth into one directory and open this as projekt in order to compile the Projekt and flash on the FM4 Board.
